# Advanced Vehicle Detection System Using YOLOv8
# Project Overview
This repository hosts step6, the final installment in a series of development stages aimed at building a sophisticated vehicle detection system capable of identifying car logos and reading license plates from video feeds. This system leverages the YOLOv8 deep learning architecture for high accuracy and performance.

# Development Process
The development of this system was structured in a series of steps from step1 to step5, each introducing new functionalities and refining the system. It is highly recommended for users to review each step to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the project’s progression. Each step is accompanied by an .avi video file demonstrating the script's functionality.
